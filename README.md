# QuantConnect MCP Server
The QuantConnect MCP Server is a bridge for AIs (such as Claude and OpenAI o3 Pro) to interact with our cloud platform. When equipped with our MCP, the AI can perform tasks on your behalf through our API such as updating projects, writing strategies, backtesting, and deploying strategies to production live-trading.

Our implementation is tested and dockerized for easy cross-platform deployment.

## Getting Started
To connect local MCP clients (like Claude Desktop) to the QC MCP Server, follow these steps:

1. Install and open [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
2. In a terminal, pull the MCP Server from Docker Hub.
```
docker pull quantconnect/mcp-server
```
3. Install and open [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).
4. In Claude Desktop, click **File > Settings > Developer > Edit Config**.
5. Edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file to include the following `quantconnect` configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantconnect": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "QUANTCONNECT_USER_ID",
        "-e", "QUANTCONNECT_API_TOKEN",
        "--name",
        "quantconnect-mcp-server",
        "quantconnect/mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "QUANTCONNECT_USER_ID": "<your_user_id>",
        "QUANTCONNECT_API_TOKEN": "<your_api_token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  To get your user Id and API token, see [Request API Token](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/community/profile#09-Request-API-Token).

6. Restart Claude Desktop.

## Debugging

### Logs
 To log to the `mcp-server-quantconnect.log` file, `import sys` and then `print("Hello world", file=sys.stderr)`.

### Inspector
 To start the inspector, run `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run src/main.py`.
 To pass a model to the inspector tool, use JSON (for example, `{"name":"My Project","language":"Py"}`).
